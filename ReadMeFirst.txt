Maybe my programme is a little bit difficult to test,
so I have attached some history records of my game in the folder.
Please transfer the records to the directory of "D:\"
You can load them in the game so that you can test some of the functions more quickly.
If there is permission error or some else problems caused by os.chidir(), please change the path parameter in my programme and set a valid path for your computer to test saving and loading functions in my programme.
Hope these game records can facilitate your marking process. ^_^
Have fun!
